# Iris Flower Species Classification Project

Welcome to the Iris Flower Species Classification project repository. This project is focused on predicting the species of iris flowers using classification techniques. The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

1. Id
2. SepalLengthCm
3. SepalWidthCm
4. PetalLengthCm
5. PetalWidthCm
6. Species

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to use machine learning classification algorithms to predict the species of iris flowers based on various features. These features include measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. By analyzing these measurements, we aim to categorize iris flowers into their respective species.

## Data
The dataset provided for this project is typically in CSV format. To ensure the proper functioning of the project, it's important that the dataset includes the columns listed above. Depending on the dataset's original format or specific data cleaning and transformation requirements, some preprocessing may be necessary.
